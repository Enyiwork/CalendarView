Version 1.1 - October 19th, 2008

 - Upgraded to Prototype 1.6 and cleaned up code to take full advantage of its
   new API features.

 - Removed our dependency on Builder from script.aculo.us, as Prototype 1.6
   has its own DOM Builder now.

 - Fixed a bug where navigating through months of the calendar would display
   the wrong year when you reached December. Thanks to Dirk Koritnik for the
   fix and for everyone who reported the issue.

Version 1.0 - March 12th, 2007

 - Initial release
